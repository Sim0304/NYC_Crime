NYC Crime Analysis Dashboard

Project Overview

Create three detailed and compelling dashboards to analyse police performance, offender profiles and arrest trends using publicly available New York City arrest data for the months of January to March in 2024. There are over 63,000 recorded arrests within the 5 New York City boroughs. Further tables were developed to gain insight into the land area, population and wealth prosperity of each borough.

Insights

•	The number of arrests peak every 3 – 4 days before dropping for the next 3 – 4 days then repeats.
•	Brooklyn had the most arrests during this period, while Staten Island has the least. There is no apparent relationship between number of arrests, GDP or population
•	Assault and larceny are the two most commit crime types by far, with the next being controlled substance cases.
•	The majority of offenders are of African American lineage, with the next largest group being classed as white-Hispanic 
•	The largest age-group of offenders is 24-44 years old, this is due to the large age gaps and where most people are within the mature years. Most common gender of arrestees are male
•	The 14th precinct in Manhatten has consistently made the highest number of arrests during this period out of 77 precincts in New York City. 

Technologies

•	Created dashboards using Power BI
•	Create a database using SQL on Microsoft SQL Service 
•	Cleaned and Manipulated data base in Power BI with Python, Power Query and DAX.
